                    <p>I'm a huge fan of <em>CoD</em>(Call of Duty) games so in my opinion I definitely recommend downloading the game
                    as you are reading this! The games are like they use to be but, I still think this <em>CoD</em> was worth
                    getting!</p>

                    <p>I love being able to just sit back and enjoy eliminating people one by one on search "n" destroy,
                    TDM can be pretty fun as well. This <em>CoD</em> made TDM seem pretty fast pace but, I am not sure. I've heard
                    other people say that this CoD is pretty weird and slow.</p>

                        <li>Download it</li>
                        <li>Play it all night</li>
                        <li>Skip school or work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Get snacks</li>
                        <li>Get your friends on</li>
