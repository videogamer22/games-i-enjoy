                     <p>I have a love hate relationship with this game, everything about it is just perfect! I love shooter
                     games but, when it comes to playing comp. I hate having teammates that just don't know what to do!
                     You try your best to do callouts and eliminate as many as you can but, the moment you die it's over</p>

                    <p>I enjoy the unrated though, it's not too bad since you don't have to take the game that serious unless
                    it's a tie than it's a different story. I recommend checking out the game on youtube, I don't think
                    you should install it quite yet because maybe it isn't your cup of tea.</p>
